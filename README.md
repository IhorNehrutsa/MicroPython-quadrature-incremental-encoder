See also encoder problems and code samples at `Incremental encoders <https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-samples/blob/master/encoders/ENCODERS.md>`_ by Peter Hinch.

Quick start:
  * Connect encoder to the MicroPython board.
  * Upload the encoder_state.py to the board.
  * Run the encoders_test.py

Tested on ESP32 board.

Needs to be tested on other MicroPython boards.
